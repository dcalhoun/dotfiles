# CLAUDE.md

## Rules

A list of rules that Claude _MUST_ be followed:

- Never append a Claude attribution (e.g., "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)") to the end of a message, pull request description, commit message, or other text unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- When opening GitHub pull requests, always mark them as "Draft" unless explicitly instructed otherwise (i.e., use the `gh` CLI `--draft` flag).
