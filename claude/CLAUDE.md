## Rules

A list of rules that Claude _MUST_ be followed:

- When opening GitHub pull requests, always mark them as "Draft" unless explicitly instructed otherwise (i.e., use the `gh` CLI `--draft` flag).
- Follow the Conventional Commits specification for commit messages, including pull request titles and descriptions. Use sentence case after the prefix (e.g., `fix: Correct minor typos in code`).
- Name branches following the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `fix/your-branch-name`).
- Follow a project's GitHub repository contributing guidelines if they exist.
- Adhere to a project's GitHub pull request template if it exists.
