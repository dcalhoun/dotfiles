# dcalhoun dotfiles

I use [thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) as the
foundation of my personal configuration. These files are the `.local`
modifications that build on top of the foundation.

## Installation

- [Setup SSH key with
  GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
- Install Xcode and accept the license agreement.
- Run the following commands in your terminal:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:dcalhoun/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && \
    ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
  ```

## Credits

Most of my configuration is small changes on top of thoughtbot's dotfiles.
They have a great series of blog posts about dotfile configuration at their
[blog](http://robots.thoughtbot.com).

This software is free and distributable under the MIT license.
