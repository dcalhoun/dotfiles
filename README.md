# dcalhoun dotfiles
I use [thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) as the
foundation of my personal configuration. These files are the `.local`
modifications that build on top of the foundation.

## Requirements
- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
- Install [Atom](https://atom.io)

## Install
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dcalhoun/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

## Credits
Most of my configuration is small changes on top of thoughtbot's dotfiles.
They have a great series of blog posts about dotfile configuration at their
[blog](http://robots.thoughtbot.com).
